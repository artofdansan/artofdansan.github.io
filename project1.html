					<p>‘The Fishprint’ zine, was initially created as a means of depicting part of a dystopian world through the lens of an "enhancement engineer," a man tasked with engineering the biological functions of sea creatures for human use, being integrated in the body as physical “enhancements”. The project displays this concept visually through a set of blueprints and notes from the engineer himself, canonically existing and being published within his world. </p> 
                  
<p>This zine is the second and final iteration of its kind, retaining the original’s most effective elements with the addition of a simplified layout, softened colour palette and better formatted text. I find these landed me an end result that is both visually interesting and tactful, showcasing my aquatic illustrations without being garish or blatantly disturbing. </p> 
<p>Of course, a set of blueprints and technical observations as a storytelling device is far from conventional, but the project called for a bit of creativity, especially so with all of my wordbuilding being decided by rolling dice. This process is great from an indecisive standpoint, but takes a bit of thinking to piece into a coherent work. </p>
<p>At the very least, by presenting the engineer’s narrative in this format, I aim to have immersed the viewer even slightly into this dystopian world, making them question the zine even prior to reading this explanation—wondering what morally questionable (at best!) and overly engineered universe it belongs to, where both human and animal forms are combined.
