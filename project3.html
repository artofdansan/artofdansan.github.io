					<p>For this project, I combined hand-generated lettering with a range of resources and materials to create impressive and colourful photos, with just my phone camera. Using both the word “REAL” and phrase “We will not tolerate design for addiction, deception, or control.” (Brian LaRossa’s 'Questioning Graphic Design’s Ethicality') on pieces of paper, I played around with different textures and light sources, like my galaxy light projector brought in from home, thick cellophane, and even a tray of water to submerge the paper in. I also used a bunch of neon, regular and glitter paints to make it more interesting, and metal cookie cutters for their reflective surfaces, which led to some really nice results. I also ripped the paper for some shots to add texture and depth, each element contributing to the overall feel of the phrase.
					</p> <p>One of my favourite setups of the set (shown in images 4 and 5) was, unsurprisingly, discovered completely by accident when I was using the cookie cutters as stamps. After stamping the full design phrase on paper, I’d set the cookie cutters down on a scrap piece to keep them from getting paint on the table. At one point I just realised they looked pretty good just resting on the paper, the mess of paints making it look like what I’d been trying to create the whole time. So I left the majority of the setup as is, rearranging only the four letters that make up ‘REAL’ amongst them all. In the 6th image, you can see this with inverted colours and a few minor edits, a version I love just as much as the original.
					</p><p>The workshop I made this in itself was all about experimentation and how materials can impact photography, so I really let myself have fun with it. Going into it I didn’t have a clear vision for the project, and didn’t really develop one at any point. I must’ve tried about twenty approaches, which is why I wanted to work with so many different materials. The holographic paper added a dreamlike quality, while the neon paint provided a bold contrast that shows up really well in the photos. Ripping up some of the paper also felt important, as it makes the photos even harder to recreate. While photography is a medium I’m nowhere near familiar with, the whole experience was incredibly rewarding and I continue to find myself a little surprised by how well the set came out.
