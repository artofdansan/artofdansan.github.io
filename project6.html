					</p><p>For my poster on interconnection, titled ‘To Coexist’, I wanted to explore the theme of mutualism with a focus on Australia, both to present it within a more personal scope and to reflect the environmental connection shared between species on Gadigal land. I had a few ideas for this one, the concept being one I think about a lot, but settled on a flower and fruit bat. My hope is that the idea comes across, without being as conventional as the pairing of flowers with bees. I chose the Waratah flower specifically, along with a fruit bat to embody the mutualistic relationships found in the region's ecosystem. While fruit bats are obviously associated with fruit, they also feed on nectar, which works perfectly with the Waratahs reliance on animals like them for pollination. Being able to apply imagery like this also gave me more options artistically, as I could try a range of mediums and markmaking methods.
					</p><p>The process of creating this piece was probably equal parts a fun new experience as well as a challenging one. Initially, I planned to hand-carve stamps using Australian plywood pine (similar to lino) to achieve a fully textured, crafted look with control over every detail. However, just a few letters into carving the title stamp, I realized this approach was overly time-consuming and was taking a toll on my hand. In future, I could find a softer wood or even get a wood-burning kit, but for this project I had to switch gears a bit. Already in a fabrication workshop for carving, I decided to instead make use of the bandsaws there. This did come with some drawbacks, losing a lot of detail and the ability to repeatedly print posters with just the one a3 piece of wood, but it did allow me to carefully cut out the Waratah and fruit bat shapes with better precision and far less strain. Then, using these shapes as stamps, I applied acrylic paint (thinned down to an ink-like consistency) and created a bunch of impressions on paper before scanning the designs in for digital refinement. While there were many more in general, I settled on two different ‘final’ iterations—one version a light pink and the other dark fuchsia. The light pink one was chosen for an in situ exhibition and feedback, but as my separate project, the two are equal. The same could be said for other possibilities within the watarah’s colouring.
					</p><p>Conceptually, I wanted this piece to evoke the theme of interdependence, where each species contributes to the wellbeing of the other. I drew vague inspiration from the animated short Kitbull, which I stumbled across not too long before starting this project. It displays mutualism through unlikely companionship, among other things. Just as in Kitbull, where two different species (and personalities) support each other, I wanted to show that even in nature, this has always been at play. 
					</p><p>There’s a lot I learned in this project, both to not underestimate the strength of wood v. my hand, but I also came to understand its structure and limitations. This reflects the themes of the piece, in a way, reinforcing an importance in understanding, openness and ecological sensitivity.
