					<p>For this project, I designed a roll-fold publication interpreting the article, "Should Designers Take Responsibility for the Ethics of Their Clients?". My approach was essenitally to create a visually appealing and complete looking article, despite being limited to an all-type layout. The content itself encourages the reader to consider the individual's ethical responsibility in design, which I tried to emphasise with the addition of bright, engaging elements. The full story can be gathered through reading it, of course, but introducing key words and/or concepts first is necessary in any good design object. Using pink and purple tones, I wanted to bring a cute and creative "designerly" feel to the publication, while also just working within my own artistic style. In terms of folds, It took me a while to settle on the roll format, as I was pretty tempted to jump into the most fun, complicated one I saw. With how I wanted to display the publication though, I think this was a good decision, allowing me to play with when the viewer sees each section. It’s a bit map-like, or a book with just a single unfolding sequence. 
					</p><p>Throughout the design process, I focused on creating a clear typographic hierarchy to help guide the reader’s eye and provide emphasis on key quotes. By experimenting with text size, weight, and placement, I brought attention to central ideas, making it easy to navigate the text even within a relatively small, compact format. The large, bold phrases create rhythm and add visual interest without overwhelming the reader. To ensure that the layout felt cohesive and balanced (an issue I didn’t even consider before receiving feedback), I completely reiterated each panel with every new addition, adjusting spacing, alignment, and in the case of adding big warped overlaid words, changing new sections to also contain warped elements. This was specifically the case with the front cover, which was completely straight/unaltered until the end, in which it had to conform to all the waviness featured on literally every other page.
					</p> <p>This project involved quite a few hiccups, mainly in typographic formatting of the text. Things like quotes being of equal size and spacing without bumping text too far off or creating widows, or fixing rags with tracking that isn’t disgustingly obvious from first glance. They’re all ultimately just common little designer issues, and were easily fixable with a bit of reiterating. Overall, I exceeded my own expectations for the project, and could see myself iterating even further as my typographic skills grow.
