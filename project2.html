					<p>
In this concertina publication, I’ve taken words and lines from Margaret Atwood’s Tracking the Rain and turned them into a typographic visualisation of literal meanings, being limited literally to the words themselves as imagery. For example, the word “shatter” can’t just be written out—it’s fragmented, with the letters falling apart as if they were caught in a storm. Being a further developed iteration of a project, I used the opportunity to further display shattering by digitally tearing the page apart itself. Another phrase, “it withholds,” is placed to the right edge of the page to cut off the last two letters, playing with the idea of ‘witholds’ being… well… withheld. Atwood’s poetry allows almost every section or word to be understood with or without context within the poem, making it incredibly fun to display literally.
					</p> <p>
This iteration is a step away from the first one, where I kept things a little too minimal with a plain white background and small touches of red. For this version, purple serves as the main color—it’s bold, deep, and my favourite colour. I felt like the typographical imagery needed a backdrop that matched their whimsical nature, so the purple sets the tone a bit. Not only this, but the choice to abandon red was a bit of a complicated one. The phrase ‘A stretched red dot,’ initially held me back, as it was the deciding factor in my original chosen colour. To make up for it, I made the purple in that section slightly more red-hued than the others. While not visible to the naked eye, I find it a pretty good compromise.
